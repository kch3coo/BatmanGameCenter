#What we should do!
I will finish my work done in time.
I will attend every team meeting and actively participate.
When an emergency arise that prevents me from attending a team meeting,
I will notify my team immediately.
The work will be divided roughly equally among all team members.
I will help my team to understand every concept in the project.
If I do not understand a concept or code, I will immediately ask for help.

#Meeting\
####on Nov 12, csc207 lab
We decided two games which are Sudoku and 2048.
Release everyone workload for the first week.
Setup the next meeting, and also ask our user interface handler, which is
Jin, to have a rough design of our project.

Peter: Sudoku\
MingJin: entire game activity setting and design\
Chris: Sudoku\
Leo: 2048 slide algorithm, move button, activity\
Jason: 2048 begin board, board manager (basic setting)

chat and help
Note tacker: MingJin\
We checked everyone's work in first week and had a conversation about design
and other problems (some specific coding problems)
We have decided the structure of our project. We roughly divided the classes involved
for our game center
Next week we should implement undo and score part. Then combine three games into gamecentre.

Ming: interface, set up class structures, abstract classes, interface\
Peter: sudoku algorithm, image and tile related issues\
Chris: sudoku algorithm, saving and loading game\
Leo: 2048 score\
Jason: 2048 undo\

####Nov 19, lab\
We need to set some design pattern and write unit test.\
Note tacker: Chris\
everyone should work on their own class. 

Ming: GameActivity, MovementController, GridView\
Peter: Abstract Tiles, tiles, bitmap slicing\
Chris: Create a class to save and load\
Leo: 2048 integrate and optimize\
Jason: sliding tile always solvable

####Nov 23,24,25, BA3200
We thought phase2 is due these days and do a lot overnight works.\
Most of the conversations and decisions were done in person.\
Note tacker: Peter

Ming: Activity and layouts, gesture detector\
Peter: Game and grid view for 2048 and sudoku using bitmap operation\
Chris: Debug and finalize the the communication between activity, controller,
and grid view.\
Leo: Improving all algorithms, unit tests\
Jason: 2048 score, unit tests

####Nov 28,29, BA2240
The last three days we fix code smells and test coverage
Note tacker: Leo

Ming: Adding pictures and background to our app\
Peter: Finalize\
